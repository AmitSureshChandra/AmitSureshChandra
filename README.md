# Amit Kesarwani 👨🏻‍💻 Jr. Software Engineer

Let me introduce myself :slightly_smiling_face: I am Amit, as you all coding is my hobby and life style. I met coding in my first year of junior college till now eager to know more about it. Although I am more passionate in mathematics & calculus but still spending more time in coding :relieved: And now I have about 1 years of web application development and design experience. I am currently working at Indigital Technologies LPP as an Jr. Software Engineer. I had also taught Maths & Science to high school students in tution classes. I couldn't spare a lot of time for my personal development due to my busy business life, I think it's time to get more active in Github, follow me :metal:
